Hello! Welcome to my homepage!

This is Fu Chen, a junior undergrad student at CUHK-Shenzhen, majoring Computer Science and Engineering. I am expected to graduate in the Artificial Intelligence stream of this major.

Well, I don't want to tell too much about academics here. While this personal page is largely created for my Fall '26 PhD application and my future publications (if there are any), even mainly for professors or researchers who want to get to know my academic performances better. However, I believe that one needs truly knowing me, looking something beyond what's on my CV. I don't mean that the following paragraphs will paint a complete picture of who I am, they are just there to share something a bit unusual for a typical PhD applicant's homepage.

--------
I was born in Fujian, China, a place I hold dear for its breathtaking natural beauty and serene lifestyle. Fujian's crisp, clean air and perpetually blue skies paint a picture of tranquility that stands in stark contrast to the bustling lives we often lead today. Growing up, I spent countless hours exploring the nearby mountains and parks, immersing myself in nature's splendor. Unfortunately, the demands of college life have limited my opportunities to revisit this idyllic setting, where time seems to move at a more leisurely pace.

I love sports, even though I'm not really that good at any of them. In high school, In my memories, I played volleyball almost every weekday. Well, I don't think I can play the sports with those 2 meter tall super giant:  so, these days, I just watch sports on TV or online. I guess I'm a 'Disloyal' fan of the NBA, or maybe Steph Curry. At least I watched every single game of Warriors 2022 playoffs. I also enjoy watching football. I clearly remember I once got up at 3 a.m. to see Germany score 7 goals in the World Cup – it was crazy! Oh, I should add that snooker is fun too, if you have ever seen Ronnie O'Sullivan pull off amazing shots. Definitely, I always have the TV locked on the sports channel - I watch almost all sorts of sports - though I can hardly play any of them, lol.

My interest in urban planning and public transportation is another defining aspect of my personality. When I visit a new city, I'm not really drawn to its history, culture, landmarks, or tourist spots. What really gets me excited is checking out its rail transit - if it has one. Though, I have to admit, if the food is super delicious, there may be an exception. For this reason, my favorite PC game, without any doubt, should be City: Skylines. (Paradox owes me a commission for all the free advertising I do!!!) I have so much fun designing road maps, building public transportation networks, and creating cute little scenes in the game. It’s super satisfying to see my virtual city thrive and my e-citizens happy. By the way, I emphasized that it is my fovorite **PC** game - you might discover why if you check my GitHub profile~

It looks like I've covered a lot about my life beyond academics. Finally, I'll briefly introduce something related to my works.

I was an OIer, i.e. participants of Olympiad in Informatics. I won two first prizes in the National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces (NOIP) junior group and four first prizes in the senior group. When I was 16, I was selected for the Fujian rovincial team and competed in the national Olympiads. A silver medal in Asia and Pacific Informatics Olymiad (APIO 2020), and a bronze medal in National Olympiads (NOI 2021) were my best scores. I never joined any programming competitions since then. Based on these awards and experiences, I have demonstrated my proficiency in problem modeling, algorithm design, and C/C++ programming. I possess a solid foundation that aligns with the skills of a professional programmer. However, I aspire to more than just programming. I believe we should address real problems and contribute to the world - viewing programming as a means to that end. Having mastered this tool, well, I am prepared to delve into research endeavors.

I began my first research project the summer before my second year at university. Following [Prof. Tianwei Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OHEbsioAAAAJ), I utilized the neuron network and dimension reduction skills to optimize an algorithm on correcting batch effects in scRNA-seq data. Then, I have my second study in Singapore under the supervision of [Prof. Louxin Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J9nFalwAAAAJ). I explored the methods of finding similarity of phylogenetic trees via the common sequences among their vector representations. As a summary, my first two research are both related to bioinformatics. The former one is based on modern data sciences with machine learning, while the latter is more focusing on traditional computational methods. These experiences enrich me with comprehensive horizons on bioinformatics, or even most data science fields. I have the experience of the novel and trending ways, and I also see the benefits of the traditional methods. I think I will benefit from these experiences and gain a broader perspective.

Now, I am open to any research area of data science (not only bioinformatics though it is definitely a good choice). I love to explore more and contribute more.
